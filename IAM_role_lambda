Go to the AWS IAM Console:

Find the IAM role that is associated with your Lambda function. You can find this information in the AWS Lambda console, under the "Execution role" section of your Lambda function.
Edit the IAM Role Policy:

Click on the IAM role's name to view its details.
In the "Permissions" tab, you will see an IAM policy attached to the role. Click on the policy name to edit it.
Attach or Replace Policy:

If there is no policy attached, you may need to create a new policy. Click on "Attach policies" and search for the policy you've created. Attach it to the role.

If there is already an existing policy, you can edit it to include the required permissions. Click on the policy name, then edit the policy document to include the necessary permissions.

Edit Policy Document:

In the policy editor, replace the existing policy document with the one I provided earlier or adjust it according to your specific requirements.
Review and Save:

Review the policy to make sure it grants the necessary permissions.
After confirming, click on "Review policy" and then "Save changes."
